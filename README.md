# Java basic projects

This is a collection of applications which are dealing with the following concepts:

- **Chronometer** : Graphic interfaces using Swing + Threads
- **FileReader** : Graphic interfaces using Swing + Working with IO streams and files
- **Home_Automation** : Singleton controller + Designing and implementing java applications + Threads
- **Railway_Traffic_Simulator** : Concept of Controller + Graphic interfaces using Swing
- **Stock_Manager** : Model-View-Controller design pattern + Graphic interfaces using Swing
- **Temperature_Monitor** : Observer-Observable design pattern + Graphic interfaces using Swing
- **Tic-tac-toe** : Graphic interfaces using Swing , GridLayout

## Chronometer

### Description
The applications containts a basic chronometer (UI) will have 2 main buttons. 
The first button starts and pauses the chronometer and the second is used to reset it. 
The chronometer is implemented as a java thread, using a class Counter, which extends Thread.
For the implentation of this behavior, functions like : wait/notify/synchrnozed are used.

### Project status

This is a basic implementation, but it can be the base for devepoling new features like:
- a better, more complex UI, which may include TextFields for the miliseconds or minutes, more buttons and more frendly graphics
- new behaviors like: counting down, programmed countdown or pop-ups to alert the user
- debouncer for the buttons
